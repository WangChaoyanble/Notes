# Five Factorizations
$$A=CR,\text{Columns in C are the independent columns in A,R is reduced echelon form of A.}\\ 
A=LU,\text{L is lower triangular and U is upper triangular.}\\ 
A=QR,\text{Q is orthogonal matrix and R is upper triangular matrix.}\\ 
S=Q\Lambda Q^T,\text{S is symmetric matrix, columns of Q is the orthogonal eigenvectors of S,elements of diagonal matrix }\Lambda \text{ is the corresponding eigenvalues.}\\ 
A=U\Sigma V^T,\text{U and V is orthogonal matrix,}\Sigma \text{ is diagonal matrix.}\\$$
