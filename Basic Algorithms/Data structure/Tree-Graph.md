# Graph
## Adjacency Matrix
For graph: $G=(V,E)$, it can be denoted as matrix $A$, where $A[i][j]$ represents a edge from $v_i$ to $v_j$, and the value represents the weight. ($0$ or $\infin$ means no edge from $v_i$ to $v_j$).

```c++
#define MaxVertexNum 100
typedef int VertexType
typedef int EdgeType
typedef struct{
    VertexType
}

```
